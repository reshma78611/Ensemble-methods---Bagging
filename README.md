# Ensemble methods---Bagging

## Bagging:
  It is also called as Bootstrap Aggregation. It is applicable on all algorithms. 
  
  Instead of taking all the data at a time and build a model, it takes sample of data from entire data and build a model let it be model 1, then it takes another sample of data from entire data and build model let it be model 2, like that it will build N number of models with different samples of data. The sample data selection is done using *Bootstrap method*. The total outcome will be average of all models outcome.
  
  In this way instead of using all the data and build a model we can take different N number of samples using bootstrap method and can consider average of all the models which increases performance of the model. It also helps to reduce *Overfitting* problem.
